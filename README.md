# Worldwise
I created WorldWise because actually being raised by a family that loves to travel, I've been inherently taught to believe that true travel isn't just about going places, rather about connecting. Several times, while navigating unfamiliar customs in various locations, I came to a realization that translation apps could only take me so far, in a sense; what I really needed, was cultural intelligence. My solution to the prompt provided is WorldWise, an application that utilizes & harnesses AI and computer vision to analyze surroundings, be it a restaurant in India, or a business meeting in Germany, etc. It is meant to instantly provide etiquette guidance, conversation tips, and social norms based on the surroundings it captures, bridging the gap between tourists and locals and fostering a more enriching and culturally enhancing experience for all! Aiming to make cultural understanding as accessible as GPS/navigation, WorldWise empowers people to engage with the world authentically, respectfully, and without barriers!!!
